Apparently we are living through a time of disruptive innovation, with the creation of new value and the destruction of old norms. Cloud computing, Big Data, the rise of open source and the internet of things are all examples of this -- or so we are told. But whilst we all have inertia to change, disruption implies that the change is unexpected, even unpredictable. However, if you have 20 years to plan for something, can you really call it surprising, random or unexpected? Alas, it turns out that companies are being disrupted by broadly predictable changes. But how can this be? The problem is poor situational awareness to the point of blindness. In this keynote, I will present the general principles of industry change and describe what can and cannot be predicted. I will then examine how companies can better understand the environment around them and by anticipating the nature of change then manipulate the market in their favor through open techniques. About Simon Wardley (Leading Edge Forum [CSC]): Simon Wardley, based in the UK, is a Researcher for CSC's Leading Edge Forum, a global research and advisory programme that explores new thinking and develops next practice roadmaps that address the major challenges at the intersection of business, IT and management. Simon's focus is on the intersection of IT strategy and new technologies, and his current research project is entitled Competing in an Open World. Simon has also recently covered topics including Learning from Web 2.0 and A Lifecycle Approach to Cloud Computing. Simon has spent the last 15 years defining future IT strategies for companies in the FMCG, Retail and IT industries. From Canon's early leadership in the cloud computing space in 2005, to Ubuntu's recent dominance as the No 1 Cloud operating system. He is a passionate advocate and researcher in the fields of open source, commoditization, innovation, organizational structure and cybernetics. As a geneticist with a love of mathematics and a fascination in economics, Simon has always found himself dealing with complex systems, whether it's in behavioural patterns, environmental risks of chemical pollution, developing novel computer systems or managing companies.

How do you keep the lights on and re-engineer the technology to be radically smaller, simpler and cheaper? How do you introduce cloud first policies? It's about culture change, it's about collective leadership, it's about trust and a lot of it is about removing blockers. We started with the Square of Despair - the four blockers of technology change - Procurement, Capability, Security, and Legacy. We aimed to build a digital government based on user needs.

Like the end of the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, there are many organizations ill-equipped with the skills and tools to be effective in the new world. However, this Digital Revolution is a marathon as opposed to a sprint. This is the evolution of how we do business, and all our organizations—public and private—have tremendous opportunities, in addition to challenges, to get ahead of the curve and thrive. In order to shed more light on the impact of new technologies and operating models on business operations, HfS Reseach surveyed, in the first half of 2015, 716 enterprise service buyers, advisors and service provider executives to understand more about how they perceive the importance of “As-a-Service.” By As-a-Service, we mean ondemand services focused on driving towards business outcomes—results that matter for your organization, and your organization’s contituents. We researched progress on achieving As-a-Service, and priorities for partnerships and investments. As described in “Beware of the Smoke: Your Platform is Burning,” while HfS sees movement along the path, the journey for many has only just begun, and there are some who have yet to realize that there is a journey to take. In supplemental research, we then focused, with input from Accenture Federal Services, a complementary survey and interviews with leaders in U.S. federal agencies to look at how we can bridge from the private sector into the public sector with the “Ideals of the As-a-Service Economy.” HfS sees evidence that there is a tangible desire to leverage the shared services and sourcing model to drive better results for the business of government. While cost cutting is part of the discussion as an outcome, it is also about providing better services to government employees and citizens, and it is about providing an opportunity for more interesting work, too. However, to get there requires bold moves in thinking and driving new operating models and technologies, and engaging current and new talent in a journey for change.","2015-09-01","2017-06-27 01:52:35","2017-06-27 01:55:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If we increase size, volume grows faster than surface area. What does this mean? The relationship between surface area and volume decreases when we increase the size. It also means that the relationship increases when we decrease the size. Take ice cubes as an example. Let's assume the larger one has a side length of 2 and the smaller ones a side length of 1. The large ice cube has less surface area per unit volume than 8 small ice cubes. Total surface area is the total area of all 6 surfaces of the ice cube. This means that 8 ice cubes have a surface area of 48 (8 x 6) versus 24 for the larger ice cube. This also means that 8 small ice cubes melt faster than one large ice cube, since the amount of heat an ice cube can absorb depend on its surface area (the melting process occurs at the surface). Whenever we make objects smaller, we get more surface area per unit volume. For example, since iron rusts when exposed to air and rusting occur at the surface, a steel knife rusts more slowly than steel wool. Disclaimer: I don't own the video content.

And there I posed the title of  this post as a statement instead of a question. &nbsp; The reason that it's a  question here is entirely driven by the context of who is currently  creating the majority of mashups these days.&nbsp; Because even a cursory  examination of what people are doing every day on the Web right now  tells us that mashups — also known as ad hoc Web sites created on the  fly out of other Web sites — are indeed happening in a large way, albeit  in simple forms, by the tens of thousands online every day.&nbsp;</p> <p><span class=""pullQuote"">The consumerization of the enterprise as younger workers bring their Web 2.0 skills and habits to work has already begun.</span>But  inside our organizations, both in the IT department and in business  units, mashups are a much rarer phenomenon.&nbsp; And in fact, this is one of  the classic hallmarks of the Web 2.0 era; the much larger community of  the Web as a major source of innovation and leading edge behavior that  subsequently moves across the firewall and into our workplaces.</p> <p>However, the topic of this blog is aimed at the application of Web  2.0 to the enterprise and so whether mashups will be a significant new  model for application development inside our businesses anytime soon is  still somewhat of an open question.&nbsp; It's worth noting that McKinsey's  recent <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">global executive survey</a> of Web 2.0 in business said that a whopping 21% of large businesses  across the board are planning investment in mashups in 2007, but a  sobering 54% of business executives also said mashups were not even  under consideration.&nbsp; Understanding the timing on mashup adoption  therefore is important along with the challenge of communicating their  potential.</p> <p>Since the mashup story is primarily being driven by spontaneous  activity at the edge of the Internet, an accurate and updated picture of  what's actually happening with them is harder to make out than if it  was being driven by a centralized industry effort.&nbsp; And as it turns out,  this makes what's happening richer and more exciting than it would be  otherwise while at the same providing significant challenges for those  that want to take these compelling ideas and apply them deliberately to  solve business problems.</p> <p>So in the interest of making sure we have the broadest industry  discussion we can about mashups — and to make sure there is some kind of  snapshot of what we think we're seeing in this space — I thought I'd  summarize the notes from my talk at the Mashup Ecosystem Summit.</p> <div style=""text-align: center;""><img title=""The Opposite Ends of the Mashup Spectrum"" src=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"" border=""0"" alt=""The Opposite Ends of the Mashup Spectrum"" hspace=""5"" width=""428"" height=""337"" /></div> <p>To bring folks that are just joining the mashup conversation up to  speed on why mashups are so exciting, I'll start with my take on the key  aspects of mashups from a value proposition perspective.</p> <p><strong>Key Aspects and Benefits of the Mashup Approach</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Effective leverage of <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Web parts</a> and the <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Global SOA</a>.</strong> Mashups are generally built out of the bits, pieces, and services of  other Web applications that already exist, adding code only when it  can't be sourced from internal or external suppliers or to provide  integration ""glue"" between the parts.&nbsp; This reuse can quickly and easily  leverage millions of dollars in previous investment and results in a ""<em>building on the shoulder's of giants</em>""  effect.&nbsp; Like the visual component marketplace successfully built  around ActiveX in the late 90's, mashups are a form of reuse that  actually works but on a much larger scale than ever before.&nbsp; See <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">ProgrammableWeb's open API cloud</a> and <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">WidgetBox</a> for a good example of the vast array Web parts that are now widely available.</li> <li><strong>Simple, lightweight software models and services.</strong> By focusing on the simplest possible techniques and formats, Web mashups  appear to be successful and widespread primarily because just about  anyone can and are creating them.&nbsp; Mashups are typically built using  techniques like cutting and pasting snippets of Javascript, using feeds  and XML to connect the various parts together, and even one-line  Javascript inclusions that can pull in and integrate an powerful  external component, such as Google Maps or a YouTube video player, that  originally required a massive investment from its creator.&nbsp; There  sometimes seems to be no limit to the effort to lower the barrier to  consumption of these Web parts.&nbsp; Both Google and YouTube are poster  children for easy Web part consumption and have reaped corresponding  rewards.&nbsp; Google makes its AdWords and Maps widgets incredibly easy to  install and deploy while YouTube even puts the hosting code next to each  and every video on its site.&nbsp; Finally, mashups are 100% pure Software  as a Service (SaaS) and require no installation, updates, plug-ins,  admin rights, or anything but a garden variety Web browser and the  mashup's URL to run. </li> <li><strong>A focus on self-service and DIY.</strong>&nbsp; As I alluded to  above, mashup development can be just as much for everyday Web users as  it is for professional software developers.&nbsp; Like so many things on the  Web that put the power of publishing and participation into everyone's  hands, mashups have the potential to give all of us the ability to  create real, useful software.&nbsp; And while end-user mashups will remain in  the bottom half or one quarter of the software complexity spectrum, it  means that applications that could never have been justified on a  build-vs.-buy perspective (and took too long to acquire to help) are now  possible&nbsp; These apps can now just be created by users — and groups of  collaborating users — on the fly as they need them.&nbsp; This has the  potential to further <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">enable the productivity of knowledge workers</a> as well as release <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">The Long Tail of IT demand</a>.&nbsp;  It could also reduce the application backlogs that continue to bedevil  IT departments and their customers everywhere.&nbsp; And to re-emphasize,  it's because mashups use such simple techniques that jsut about anyone  can now create the views, dashboards, and even real software apps that  let them get their work done better and faster without unnecessary  bureaucracy (some bureaucracy <em>is</em> required as I indicate  below).&nbsp; I've been collecting real-world examples of this in the  workplace and will share them in an upcoming post. </li> </ul> <p>There are numerous smaller, ancillary benefits of mashups including  the fact they are Web-oriented and 1) can leverage link structure, 2)  tend to be more open and visible which results in more transparency and  information sharing, and 3) their content can even be discoverable by  search if some care is taken.&nbsp; In this way, they become part of the <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Enterprise 2.0 story</a> as well, particularly if they are socially enabled.&nbsp; Fortunately, a good number of widgets, such as those from <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">txtDrop</a> and <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">MyBlogLog</a>, make it easy to add simple social aspects to mashups to enable their full power.</p> <p><strong>Not convinced anyone can build mashups?&nbsp; <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">View a screencast</a> of an entire application being built out of Web parts in 15 minutes using IBM's QEDWiki platform (link near bottom)</strong></p> <p>This also doesn't mean there aren't challenges and a few drawbacks to  mashups which I'll highlight below.&nbsp; For now, it's enough to keep in  mind that the three major benefits including <em>high-levels of reuse and leverage</em>, <em>models that support rapid, easy development and integration</em>, and a <em>focus on DIY</em> by anyone from expert developers to newbie Web users.</p> <p><strong>The Challenges and Opportunities of Mashups</strong></p> <p><strong>Mashup Challenges</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Deconflicting the two major mashup models.&nbsp;</strong> Right  now mashups are happening mostly ""in the wild"" with users taking their  blogs, wiki pages, MySpace profiles, and even ordinary Web pages and  covering them with badges, widgets, and gadgets from elsewhere on the  Web.&nbsp; On the high end of the complexity spectrum, there are about 2,000  developer created mashups presently available (Source: <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">ProgrammableWeb</a>.) There is also now a <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">growing body of tools</a> from commercial software vendors that also try to bring the apparent  advantages of mashups to the business world, both on the Web and in our  intranets.&nbsp; In general, these two mashup models are quite different from  each other.&nbsp; On the consumer Web we have the natural, emergent mashup  phenomenon as numerous Web parts suppliers and their consumers try  different strategies out and sometimes hit upon the models that work  best (which appears to be things like one-line includes, cut-and-paste,  and smart widgets that make integration easy, with Google Maps being  another great example.)&nbsp; On the vendor side, enterprise mashup tools try  to add missing enterprise context like security, support for local  SOAs, and so on, as well as a mashup development model, usually by  choosing a particular Web component standard and providing a visual IDE  that makes it easier for the non-HTML savvy to create mashups.&nbsp; These  commercial mashup application models try to <em>a priori </em>figure out  what will work best and in this they may be making the mistake of  ignoring the vast laboratory of the Web that is already proving out  highly effective models for mashup parts and integration strategies on a  large scale.&nbsp; There is also a skill and open/closed barrier between  these two approaches that tends to prevent the movement or migration  from model to the other.&nbsp; My best guess is that the commercial mashup  tools that will succeed the best will eliminate this barrier or at least  greatly reduce it. </li> <li><strong>Too many widget formats.</strong>&nbsp; Both Microsoft and Google have their own gadget models, NetVibes has the compelling <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Universal Widget Architecture (UWA)</a>, and OpenAjax has no component model <em>per se </em>but <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">vital strategies</a> for making Web parts work together in the same mashup.&nbsp; Even the  venerable and respected W3C has gotten in the act with a first draft of  the <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Widgets 1.0 specification</a>.  Visual tool support is important to fully enable mashup development and  realize the productivity potential and this support requires a  consistent widget format.&nbsp; But the proliferation of widget models (both  ad hoc and formal specs) makes visual tooling expensive and  time-consuming to implement.&nbsp; And though the greater Web has been  relatively successful so far without them, enterprises are not yet  anxious to start figuring out which widget models are the most  important.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no obvious solution is on the horizon though  some early techniques have formed including wrapping the different  component models into a standard widget wrapper.</li> <li><strong>Not enough Web services exist in our enterprises or on the Web.</strong>&nbsp;  While the number of open APIs on the Internet continues to grow quickly  (431 by last count according to Programmable Web), there just aren't  enough Web services available to supply the data and back-end  functionality to mashups.&nbsp; Most data on the Internet and our intranets  are still in static Web pages in the form of HTML.&nbsp; While the growing  adoption of XHTML helps a little, the greater service-enablement of the  Web will take years and years.&nbsp; In the meantime we need to quickly  service-enable our silos of Web-based information if we are to fully  exploit it.&nbsp; Fortunately, this challenge can now be partially mitigated  with companies like <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Kapow</a> and Yahoo with <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Pipes</a>, which are providing just such tools to make this possible.&nbsp; I recently did a <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">screencast</a> using Kapows' RoboMaker showing how Web 1.0 content can be transformed  into a Web 2.0 friendly service format like RSS in a few minutes using  visual tools.&nbsp; (Disclaimer: I have a client relationship with Kapow.)&nbsp;  Also note that this challenge is one reason why widgets have grown so  popular, since they offer both a data connection back to the server they  came from as well as a visual aspect that allows the information to be  seen and integrate with.&nbsp; Thus widgets are ideal for consumption by  providing a sort of easy-to-use ""visual SOA."" </li> <li><strong>Security and identity need to be sorted out.</strong>&nbsp; The  most useful mashups will involve Web-based creations that are powered  with our personal and business information.&nbsp; For now, most mashups don't  require (or support) logins that allow it to collect information from  your private repositories of information.&nbsp; While initiatives like <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">OpenID</a> have the potential to resolve some of these issues, there is a lot of  work to be done before the average user will trust a mashup with access  to their private information.&nbsp; This shortcoming fundamentally limits the  real value that mashups have the potential to provide.&nbsp; While mashup  security is actually a long topic byself, I'll save a deeper discussion  for another post. </li> <li><strong>No common creation metaphor.</strong>&nbsp; Other major Web 2.0  platforms such as blog and wikis have very simple, well-known usage  models.&nbsp; There is a save button, an edit button, and either a reverse  chronology of posts (blogs) or a series of page revisions (wikis).&nbsp;  However, other than the aforementioned simple cut-and-paste model,  nothing has really emerged in a similar vein for the creation of  mashups.&nbsp; This will resolve itself slowly as some widgets now have  configuration popups or easy code generators to get what you need done  without needing to be a Javascript expert.&nbsp; However this is a far cry  from having a development model that is generally well understood by  most people and well documented.&nbsp; I often say that spreadsheets and  Microsoft Access are the end-user development tools most of us have  today and they offer some insight, as well as blogs and wikis, into what  a workable model might look like.&nbsp; Offering some hope, mashup vendors  are exploiting the near ubiquity of the blog and wiki model and IBM has  merged mashup development with wikis with <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">QEDWiki</a> and Dan Bricklin has done something similar with wikis and spreadsheets with <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">WikiCalc</a>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Mashup Opportunities</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Defining the essential ingredients of a successful mashup ecosystem.</strong>&nbsp;  This is about conveying a clear conception to the marketplace that we  really are moving more from green field development to a world where we  assemble our software out of the rich content and functionality we now  have ready access to on the Web and our SOAs.&nbsp; Other ecosystem  questions: What kind of Web services do you need?&nbsp; How about adapters to  legacy systems and content?&nbsp; Should you encourage mashups to be the  foundation for other mashups? How do we guarantee compatibility and  interoperability?&nbsp; These and a lot more issues about how to create a  successful mashup ecosystem need to be better articulated than they have  been to date.</li> <li><strong>Addressing the tension between the two major styles of integration.&nbsp; </strong>Most  integration today is done up front with lots of testing and  configuration control and baselined code from your external suppliers.&nbsp;  On the other hand, mashups rely on live pulls of code from your supplier  and are a much more extreme form of combining our systems together.&nbsp;  The very word ""mashup"" conveys how ad hoc this really is.&nbsp; This new live  model of integration has security, testing, and version control issues  written all over it.&nbsp; Google and some of the larger suppliers are  getting a handle on some of these but market leadership on this could go  a long way.</li> <li><strong>Providing effective ""enterprise context.""&nbsp;</strong> Mashups  are a creation of the consumer Web and are not always ready to ""play"" in  the enterprise space.&nbsp; To even get a foot in the door, enterprise  mashup tools need to have solid stories around single sign-on (SSO),  LDAP, JSR168 (portals/portlets), legacy integration, management,  monitoring, RSS strategy, etc.&nbsp; Most enterprise tools are still falling  short in these categories and will likely not get broad adoption until  they address them. </li> <li><strong>Distribution and consumption.&nbsp; </strong>Many of the ideas  that the consumer Web has come up with for Web parts to be highly viral,  easily distributable, and eminently consumable are also <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">important strategies</a> that we must think seriously about moving into our SOA initiatives.&nbsp;  That's because our internal SOAs are smaller versions of the very same  ecosystem that we have seen form on the Web.&nbsp; Getting services adopted  and used in the enterprise has been entirely too hard up until now and  even many companies out on the Web are falling short of in terms of  applying the latest low-barrier, viral distribution techniques for  success and uptake.</li> <li><strong>SEO, analytics, page views are all challenged by the mashup model.</strong>&nbsp;  Just like Ajax and Flash, mashups turn single Web pages into entire  applications and all three of these Web application models have been  slow to address some of the more important models and monetization  strategies that power business on the Web.&nbsp; There is ample room for  companies that let mashup creators address the loss of these important  aspects of Web usage.&nbsp; </li> </ul> <p>As I read through this list, it's a clear that I've tried to address  both consumer and enterprise mashups, two very different beasts with a  somewhat different audience.&nbsp; I say somewhat different since the  consumerization of the enterprise as younger workers bring their Web 2.0  skills and habits to work has already begun.&nbsp; For now however, it's  seems clear that whatever the adoption speed, mashups are here to stay  as one of the most compelling and efficient ways to turn time and money  into working software and solve business problems in new and innovative  ways.</p>","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\V74F7Q6D\106.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Everyone has their own opinion  on how it should be approached and from time to time you get little  clusters of folks that follow the same mantra, whether it be “agile  methods”, “extreme programming”, “waterfall model”, etc. The underlying  argument tends to be whether one thinks of programming and development  as a science or an art. Before we get into the good stuff I thought it’d  be nice if I could express my view on the matter and set some  expectations when it comes to my code and even the topics I choose to  post about. To me, software development isn’t an art or a science. It  lives in that happy middle ground I commonly call a craft.&nbsp; That's  right, I'm a digital basket weaver.</p> <p>First let's talk about my  view on science.&nbsp; Science is a well defined method of making  observations on laws and systems that you did not create and therefore  have no control over.&nbsp; If you understand the system well enough you can  influence it and that is what I like to think of as application of  scientific principles, or engineering.&nbsp; One thing is very important  here: scientists don't create or produce anything.&nbsp; For example, Newton  didn't create gravity he discovered it.&nbsp; Further, an engineer building a  bridge doesn't defy or change gravity to make the bridge stay up he  simply offsets its effect with other forces.&nbsp; Eventually gravity wins  and the bridge falls, the engineer just applied scientific knowledge to  delay the inevitable.</p> <p>Given my definition of science software  development doesn't really fit in there.&nbsp; Sure, you can take a look the  basic principles of the theory of computation and say, ""Look, there's  the science!"" You'd be right of course, that is science, Computer  Science in fact which isn't what we are discussing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Software  development isn't exactly engineering either, is it? One could argue  that development is just the application of those scientific principles  that Computer Science gives us and in some cases I think that line of  reasoning would bear fruit.&nbsp; What makes software development different  from traditional engineering and allows us to call it a craft boils down  to two things.</p> <ol> <li>Software development introduces the concept of easy way and hard way </li> <li>Software development introduces the concept of beauty </li> </ol> <p>As  to item one, the theory of computation has the potential to tell us  exactly what is and is not computable (it hasn't given us that yet, but I  digress).&nbsp; Further, it can tell us the optimal way to compute  something.&nbsp; It can not, however, tell us the optimal way to build the  computation in terms of time, materials, and customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Item  two is most likely the biggest digression from engineering.&nbsp; Bridges  are functional.&nbsp; Machines are, or can be made to be, ergonomic.&nbsp; Rarely  is beauty considered and when it is, it is approached solely from the  perspective of pure art.&nbsp; That is, what the human mind and eye see as  beautiful.</p> <p>In software development beauty has some of those  elements, predominantly in the user interface, but it also has a  structural element.&nbsp; Even in architecture who is looking at the beauty  of the steel girders holding up the building? In software&nbsp; development,  the girders are supposed to be beautiful too.</p> <p>No method can  provide that beauty with any form of guarantee in the same way that  calculations can be performed to build a functional bridge.&nbsp; We are  victims of our own minds.&nbsp; In software development there is no golden  ratio.</p> <p>So, like a basket weaver, we as developers must produce  using nothing but the most basic of principles and to our own (or our  client's) perception of beauty.&nbsp; This typically requires long  apprenticeship under more senior craftsmen and a whole lot of trial and  error.</p> <p>Methodologies, or perhaps more accurately philosophies,  of software design and implementation like extreme programing don't map  to science because they don't provide a universal system that works in  all cases.&nbsp; Science is predicated on a single methodology called the  scientific method.&nbsp; Employing the scientific method guarantees that a  scientist's work is valid.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no such guarantee when a  developer uses any of the prevailing design philosophies because even if  you end up with a working product it may not satisfy the client.&nbsp;  Nearly everything is subjective and the developer is at the mercy of the  client, the product either isn't fast enough, not pretty enough, or not  easy enough to use and it isn't going to matter to the client whether  it was built using extreme programming or agile methods.&nbsp; This doesn't  occur with science as we can see with another Newton example.&nbsp; I doubt  anyone pointed at Newton's work and said, ""Gravity isn't elegantly  constructed or convenient to use, we are opting to wait for Gravity  2.0"".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Alright, so what is my philosophy and is it  universal?&nbsp; I don't really have one, so no it isn't universal.&nbsp; I try  and organize my architecture in the way that best allows me to execute  on my client's wishes and I try to keep my client's involved as much as  possible by delivering relevant iterations of the software.&nbsp; The  relevant part is the key as a typical client isn't going to care that in  this version we structure our stored procedures thusly while blah blah  blah.&nbsp; A client only cares about the parts they care about (makes sense  right?) and our job as developers is to show them that.</p> <p>I am not  saying that extreme programming or any of the other philosophies don't  work, I am sure there is enough evidence out there to show they do in  fact work.&nbsp; What I am saying is that you don't know if they are going to  work, only that they have.&nbsp; Methodologies are developed from a set of  project post-mortem's so they are only going to have good coverage for  projects that you've already completed and <em>maybe</em> a project you <em>think</em> might be close enough to the others you've already done for this particular approach to work.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, as Forest said, that's all I have to say about that.&nbsp; From here on out it will be</p>","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\Q9HMDMR9\116710.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before we get into the of the different  									models, we shall have a brief insight about the basics that spread throughout  									these models.</p> <p>Like any other engineering products, software products are oriented towards  									customers. It is either market driven (or) it drives the market. Customer  									Satisfaction was the buzzword of the 80's. Customer Delight is today's buzzword  									and Customer Ecstasy is the buzzword of the new millennium. Products that are  									not customer (user) friendly have no place in the market although they are  									engineered using the best technology. The interface of the product is as  									crucial as the internal technology of the product.</p> <p><span class=""oranpipebigbold2"">Market Research</span><br /> Market study is made to identify the potential customers need. This process is  									also known as market research. In the market research, the already existing  									need and the possible/potential needs that are available in a segment of the  									society is studied carefully. The market study is done based on lot of  									assumptions. Assumptions are the crucial factors in the development or  									inception of a product development. Unrealistic assumptions can become a  									nosedive in the entire venture. Though assumptions are abstract, there should  									be a move to develop tangible assumptions to come up with a successful product.</p> <p><span class=""oranpipebigbold2"">Research and Development</span><br /> Once the Market study is made, the customer's need is given to the Research and  									Development (R&amp;D) Department to conceptualize a cost-effective system that  									could potentially solve customer's need better than the competitors. Once the  									conceptual system is developed and tested in a hypothetical environment, the  									development team takes control of it. The development team adopts one of the  									software development methodologies that is given below, develop the proposed  									system, and gives it to the customers.</p> <p>The Marketing group starts selling the product to the available customers and  									simultaneously work in developing a niche segment that could potentially buy  									the product. In addition, the marketing group passes the feedback from the  									customers to the developers and the R&amp;D group to make possible value  									additions in the product.</p> <p>While developing a product, the company outsources** the non-core activities to  									the other companies who specialize in those activities. This accelerates the  									product development process largely. Some companies work on tie-ups to bring  									out highly matured product in a short period.</p> <p class=""bluekbold"">Following are the basic popular models used by many software  									development firms.</p> <ul> <li> System Development Life Cycle Model </li> <li> Prototyping Model </li> <li> Rapid Application Development Model </li> <li> Component Assembly Model </li> </ul> <p class=""orangetop""><a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""bluekbold"">Let us watch one by one in the following chapters.</p> <p>System Development Life Cycle Model<br /> This is also known as Classic Life Cycle Model (or) Linear Sequential Model  									(or) Waterfall Method. This has the following activities.</p> <p>1. System/Information Engineering and Modeling</p> <p>2. Software Requirements Analysis</p> <p>3. Systems Analysis and Design</p> <p>4. Code Generation</p> <p>5. Testing</p> <p>6. Maintenance</p> <p class=""orangetop""><a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">System/Information Engineering and Modeling</span><br /> As software is always of a large system (or business), work begins by  									establishing requirements for all system elements and then allocating some  									subset of these requirements to software. This system view is essential when  									software must interface with other elements such as hardware, people and other  									resources. System is the basic and very critical requirement for the existence  									of software in any entity. So if the system is not in place, the system should  									be engineered and put in place. In some cases to extract the maximum output,  									system should be re-engineered and spiced up. Once the ideal system is  									engineered or tuned up, the development team studies the software requirement  									for the system.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Software Requirements Analysis</span><br /> This is also known as feasibility study. In this phase, the development team  									visits the customer and studies their system. They investigate the need for  									possible software automation in the given system. By the end of the feasibility  									study, the team furnishes a document that holds the different specific  									recommendations for the candidate system. It also includes the personnel  									assignments, costs, project schedule, and target dates. The requirements  									gathering process is intensified and focussed specially on software. To  									understand the nature of the program(s) to be built, the system engineer  									(""analyst"") must understand the information domain for the software,  									as well as required function, behavior, performance and interfacing. The  									essential purpose of this phase is to find the need and to define the problem  									that needs to be solved .</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">System Analysis and Design</span><br /> In this phase, the software's overall structure and its nuances are defined. In  									terms of the client/server technology, the number of tiers needed for the  									package architecture, the database design, the data structure design etc are  									all defined in this phase. Analysis and Design are very crucial in the whole  									development cycle. Any glitch in the design phase could be very expensive to  									solve in the later stage of the software development. Much care is taken during  									this phase. The logical system of the product is developed in this phase.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Code Generation</span><br /> The design must be translated into a machine-readable form. The code generation  									step performs this task. If design is performed in a detailed manner, code  									generation can be accomplished with out much complication. Programming tools  									like Compilers, Interpreters, Debuggers are used to generate the code.  									Different high level programming languages like C, C++, Pascal, Java are used  									for coding. With respect to the type of application, the right programming  									language is chosen.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Testing</span><br /> Once the code is generated, the program testing begins. Different testing  									methodologies are available to unravel the bugs that were committed during the  									previous phases. Different testing tools and methodologies are already  									available. Some companies built there own testing tools that are tailor made  									for there own development operations.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Maintenance</span><br /> Software will definitely undergo change once it is delivered to the customer.  									There are many reasons for the change. Change could happen because of some  									unexpected input values into the system. In addition, the changes in the system  									could directly affect the software operations. The software should be developed  									to accommodate changes that could happen during the post implementation period.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Prototyping Model</span><br /> This is a cyclic version of the linear model. In this model, once the  									requirement analysis is done and the design for a prototype is made, the  									development process gets started. Once the prototype is created, it is given to  									the customer for evaluation. The customer tests the package and gives his/her  									feed back to the developer who refines the product according to the customer's  									exact expectation. After a finite number of iterations, the final software  									package is given to the customer. In this methodology, the software is evolved  									as a result of periodic shuttling of information between the customer and  									developer. This is the most popular development model in the contemporary IT  									industry. Most of the successful software products have been developed using  									this model - as it is very difficult (even for a whiz kid!) to comprehend all  									the requirements of a customer in one shot. There are many variations of this  									model skewed with respect to the project management styles of the companies.  									New versions of software product evolve as a result of prototyping.</p> <p class=""orangetop""><a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model</span><br /> The RAD is a linear sequential software development process that emphasizes an  									extremely short development cycle. The RAD model is a ""high speed""  									adaptation of the linear sequential model in which rapid development is  									achieved by using a component-based construction approach. Used primarily for  									information systems applications, the RAD approach encompasses the following  									phases:</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Business modeling</span><br /> The information flow among business function is modeled in a way that answers  									the following questions: 									<br /> What information drives the business process? 									<br /> What information is generated? 									<br /> Who generates it? 									<br /> Where does the information go?<br /> Who processes it?</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Data modeling</span><br /> The information flow defined as part of the business modeling phase is refined  									into a set of data objects that are needed to support the business. The  									characteristic (called attributes) of each object share identified and the  									relationships between these objects are defined.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Process modeling</span><br /> The data objects defined in the data-modeling phase are transformed to achieve  									the information flow necessary to implement a business function. Processing the  									descriptions are created for adding, modifying, deleting, or retrieving a data  									object.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Application generation</span><br /> RAD assumes the use of the RAD tools like VB, VC++, Delphi etc rather than  									creating software using conventional third generation programming languages.  									The RAD works to reuse existing program components (when possible) or create  									reusable components (when necessary). In all cases, automated tools are used to  									facilitate construction of the software.</p> <p class=""bluekbold"">Testing and turnover</p> <p>Since the RAD process emphasizes reuse, many of the program components have  									already been tested. This minimizes the testing and development time.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Component Assembly Model</span><br /> Object technologies provide the technical framework for a component-based  									process model for software engineering. The object oriented paradigm emphasizes  									the creation of classes that encapsulate both data and the algorithm that are  									used to manipulate the data. If properly designed and implemented, object  									oriented classes are reusable across different applications and computer based  									system architectures. Component Assembly Model leads to software reusability.  									The integration/assembly of the already existing software components accelerate  									the development process. Nowadays many component libraries are available in the  									Internet. If the right components are chosen, the integration aspect is made  									much simpler.</p> <p><span class=""bluekbold"">Conclusion</span><br /> All these different models have their own advantages and disadvantages.  									Nevertheless, in the contemporary commercial software development world, the  									fusion of all these methodologies is incorporated. Timing is very crucial in  									software development. If a delay happens in the development phase, the market  									could be taken over by the competitor. Also if a 'bug' filled product is  									launched in a short period of time (quicker than the competitors), it may  									affect the reputation of the company. So, there should be a tradeoff between  									the development time and the quality of the product. Customers don't expect a  									bug free product but they expect a user-friendly product. That results in  									Customer Ecstasy!</p>","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\538TP2AE\software_philosophy.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(It could also be about implications, ethics, or other more  contextual matters, but those shall be left aside.) And it may be an  even more appropriate candidate.</p> <p>Russell says: “Philosophy . . . aims at . . . the kind of  knowledge which gives unity and system to the body of the sciences, and  the kind which results from a critical examination of the grounds of our  convictions, prejudices, and beliefs.”. But its status is kept always  provisional, as Russell says also: “. . . as soon as definite knowledge  concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject ceases to be  called philosophy, and becomes a separate science.”. So it is more about  trying than knowing, though if its scope is of the right kind, then the  products can be real and valuable.</p> <p>Software is the right kind of subject for philosophy to be  fruitful: As far as a subject has logical structure then clarifying and  organising its thought can help. And as far as a subject has uncertainty  then philosophy has a place. Software seems well suited. It is a young  field, entirely made of thought, spanning a range of certainty.</p> <p>A first approach is to compare software with other similar  disciplines, such as the building industry. And how they appear to  relate leads to closer examination of their constituents. In the  background is always an implicit form sought in results. Perhaps for  software this would, or <em>could</em>, be the structures found in software itself: recursion is apt.</p> <p>As an early, basic result, the subject can be divided into two  major parts: philosophy of software architecture, alongside philosophy  of software engineering – each assuming a meaning more faithful to the  building industry.</p>","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\6KWTPAZT\note-hxa7241-20090410T1636.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feick","","","","","","","Tourism planning decisions involve varying degrees of participation from multiple interests, some of which may differ substantially in their objectives, relative authority, and perception of key issues. This article focuses on applying Geographic Information System technology within a customized software design to allow multiple participants from various sectors to designate land parcels appropriate for tourism-related development or for a competing land use. The approach adopted allows the degree of consensus in land designations to be identified and visualized in map form. A small sample of participants with diverse interests in land use and tourism planning issues apply this tool to a sample tourism planning study in West Bay District of Grand Cayman, British West Indies. The findings of the sample application are discussed, with emphasis given to the contributions that this type of information system can offer policy makers concerned with contentious tourism-related planning and management decisions.","","2011-10-12 04:02:20","2011-10-12 04:03:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

At the beginning of a project, comparatively little is known about the product or work results, and so estimates are subject to large uncertainty. As more research and development is done, more information is learned about the project, and the uncertainty then tends to decrease, reaching 0% when all residual risk has been terminated or transferred.

There's waterfall, where Dr. Winston W. Royce points out the problems while promoting the method.  There's the heated (to say heated is an understatement, is an understatement) debates over XP, Scrum, ad nauseum  (<a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">the big list of methods</a>).  The arguments rarely result in new useful information.  They always end in the state of ""my way is better than yours.""</p> <p>Besides, everyone knows Scrum is the <em>right</em> way <tt>:-)</tt></p> <p>I want to move to the next level.  Let's talk about software development philosophies.  Because, I think these have a much greater impact on software development than methodologies.  Pick a methodology.  It has a record of amazing success in one place and utter failure in another.</p> <p>And, let's face it, <strong>some teams just succeed</strong> no matter how they go about a project.  Unfortuneately, some teams always find the opposite.</p> <p>Why is this?</p> <p>I posit that even when the whole team follows the same methodology,  they may have completely disparate development philosophies.  Some folks just want to get it done, regardless of costs.  Others focus on beauty, and many disagree on the meaning of beautiful  code.  And, some just don't care.</p> <h2>Philosophy Matters</h2> <p>I claim, your development philosophy matters.  Many haven't thought about it yet, everyone in the business has some  set of core beliefs about what is important in development.  How code <em>should</em> be done, what good code is, what part of the process is more important.</p> <p>How you value each step of development and where importance is placed  make the biggest impact in the development of an application.  Ultimately, your values and philosophy impact how your methodology is  executed.</p> <p>Wikipedia has a page on  <a href=""/../../../../zotero.jar%21/content/zotero/tinymce/note.html"">development philosophies</a> But, I think it confuses the issue.  Those are really methodologies.</p> <p>A search on Google reveals many blog posts of individuals stating their personal development philosophies.  I think it says a great deal when someone is willing to draw the line in the sand and say what their principles are.</p> <p>But, of course, my development philosophy <em>really</em> is the best one...</p>","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\JTNBKMDT\opinion.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As described in “ beware of the smoke: your platform is burning ,” while hfs sees movement along the path , the journey for many has only just begun, and there are some who have yet to realize that there is a journey to take. in supplemental research, we then focused , with input from accenture federal services, a complementary survey and interviews with leaders in U.S. federal agencies to look at how we can bridge from the private sector into t he public sector with the “ideals of the as - a - service economy. ” hfs sees evidence that there is a tangible desire to leverage the shared services and sourcing model to drive better results for the business of government. while cost cutting is part of the discussion as an outcome, it is also about providing better services to government employees and citizens, and it is about providing an opportunity for more interesting work, too. however, to get there requires bold moves in thinking and driving new operati ng models and technologies, and engaging current and new talent in a journey for change.","2015-09-01","2017-07-25 01:01:45","2017-07-25 01:11:42","2017-07-25 01:01:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ano.tisam\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\rmc29qa5.default\zotero\storage\PAAWVZ9F\Accenture-Government-as-a-Service-Eight-Ideals-of-As-a-Service-Help-Federal-Agencies-Find-New-V.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
